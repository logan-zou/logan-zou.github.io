                <strong>A Neural-Ensemble Learning Method for Migration Prediction Based on Culinary Taste Data in China</strong>
                <br>
                <li>Accepted by <b>SCI</b> <a herf='http://www.ybook.co.jp/jnca.html'>Journal of Nonlinear and Convex Analysis</a></li>
                <li>Authors: <b>Zou Yuheng</b>, Huang Yicheng, Yan Chengxin, La Lei</li> 
                <li>Abstract: Population migration is an important problem related to national
                  economic and social development, and migration data can be applied to research
                  in many fields. But population loss often puts huge pressure on local governments,
                  so migration data are not disclosed in many cases. Most of the existing migration
                  prediction models are based on non open source data, when other researchers
                  want to apply existing population migration prediction models to carry out their
                  own prediction tasks, they often find that they cannot obtain the same data
                  source. This paper proposes a Neural-Ensemble learning method for migration
                  prediction based on taste data in China. The whole method can be divided
                  into three parts. First, classify the restaurants into different cuisines, calculate
                  the taste of each cuisine based on the recipe data and then obtain the taste
                  matrix of China. In this step, we propose a method for restaurant classification
                  called Neural-Ensemble Classification, which combines the BERT and dictionary
                  matching. Then we construct a Markov Chain to predict the vector of migration
                  at the same time with restaurant data based on the historical migration data.
                  Finally, we build a prediction model based on the LightGBM, which uses the
                  taste matrix as input and the vector of migration as output. Compared with
                  existing models, this model can use open data to achieve the prediction accuracy
                  no lower than existing models.</li>

                <strong>A Comparative Study of China And the United States' Digital Economy Policies Based on Cross-lingual Mode</strong>
                <br>

                <li>Authors: <b>Zou Yuheng</b>, Lu Dongyuan</li>
                <li>Abstract: In the context of escalating Sino-American strategic competition, a comparative study of Chinese and the USA 
                  digital economy policies bears significant strategic value. Traditional methods of policy comparison are limited by cost, can ’t 
                  solve this problem well. This paper focuses on the contrast between digital economy policies in China and th e USA, proposing 
                  a resolution framework based on a cross-language model. This framework enables the comparison of digital economy policy 
                  environments in both countries based on massive policy data and further suggests policy recommendations for the develop ment 
                  of the digital economy. This paper offers a solution for comparing policy environments across different political systems, 
                  providing a comprehensive and objective portrayal of the disparities in digital economy policy environments. Concurrently, it
                  also brings a fresh perspective to policy comparison research.</li>

                <strong>Why Guests Write Negative Comments for Budget Hotels：Research Based on Aspect Extraction</strong>
                <br>
                <li>Accepted by <b>SCI</b> <a herf='http://www.ybook.co.jp/jnca.html'>Journal of Nonlinear and Convex Analysis</a></li>
                <li>Authors: La Juanjuan, La Lei, <b>Zou Yuheng</b></li> 
                <li>Abstract: Negative comments reﬂect customer dissatisfaction. Identifying this
                  dissatisfaction is of high signiﬁcance to improve the hotel industry. At present,
                  the mining of negative comments mainly focuses on luxury hotels. In fact, budget
                  hotels occupy a large market share. This paper proposes a method for online
                  comment extraction in the hotel ﬁeld. The method realizes weakly-supervised
                  learning based on BiLSTM and CRF and can further improve the extraction
                  performance by using a labeled open dataset in the hotel domain. The real-world
                  application of the proposed method reveals the dissatisfaction of economy hotel
                  customers mainly focuses on the price, noise, service, and cleanliness of facilities.
                  Experimental results also show that the proposed method has a higher F1 score
                  in the supervised and weakly-supervised situations than the control methods. It
                  is a powerful tool for managers and researchers in the hospitality industry and
                  can support many downstream applications.</li>

                <li>Organized by <a herf='http://challenge.xfyun.cn/topic/info?type=abstract-of-the-paper'>iFLYTEK</a></li>
                <li>For the tasks of text classification and keyword extraction, 
                we proposed a solution algorithm combining 6B fine-tuned LLM with GPT-4 supervision, achieving Top 3 in the preliminary round and Top 1 in the long-term competition.</li>

                <li>Organized by <a herf='http://challenge.xfyun.cn/topic/info?type=person-post-matching-2023'>iFLYTEK</a></li>
                <li>for the task of matching resumes and job positions, 
                we proposed two solution algorithms: desensitized data re-pretraining + full-process Fine-tune Bert + long-text strategy 
                and feature engineering + autogluon. Both approaches achieved Top3.</li>                <!-- <li></li>  -->

                <li>Developed a research polishing tool based on LLMs, 
                implementing functions such as paper polishing, automatic abstract generation, and citation creation.
                We are also trying to finetune a domain-specific LLM for ourselves.</li>                <!-- <li></li>  -->

                <strong>Top 50 - 'Spark Cup' Cognitive LLM Scene Innovation Competition</strong>
                <li>Organized by <a herf='http://challenge.xfyun.cn/topic/info?type=person-post-matching-2023'>iFLYTEK</a></li>

                Based on the open-source project Chat-Zhenhuan, 
                combined with iFlytek's LLM Spark, 
                we have built a personalized AI system that is highly efficient, serviceable, and suitable for commercial use. 
                We have proposed a solution that combines general LLMs with locally fine-tuned LLMs, 
                overcoming the service limitations of fine-tuning open-source LLMs.</li>                <!-- <li></li>  -->
